To kick things off Vita Nova will be giving away merchandise crafted in-home by Metrox to the viewers of the stream in the form of NFTs. These can either be sold on the open market or redeemed for the physical item.

- **Apparel** – T-shirts, Hoodies with Vita Nova artwork.
- **Cogley's 3D printed Sunglasses** – 3D printed Cogley Eyes on a pair of sunglasses for maximum swag.

Metrox's workshop is the home base of SODA—a maker's dream with zones for 3D printing, laser cutting, textile printing and embroidery, and more. It's all about creative small-batch production with machines for whatever the project demands.
