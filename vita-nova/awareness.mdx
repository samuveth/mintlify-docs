description: "Vita Nova's awareness capabilities"
---

We believe that for Vita Nova to truly excel as an entertainer, it must have a high level of awareness, much like a human streamer that's aware of everything from how they appear on-screen to messages in the chat, incoming donations and current real-world events. Vita Nova already has these capabilities in an early form - reading the chat, shouting out donations, and a basic self-awareness of what viewers see on the video feed.

## Future Enhancements:

- **Expression**: Refine self-monitoring and implement behavior trees so it can seamlessly adapt and convey emotions dynamically.
- **Data Sources**: Connecting to additional external data sources like X, news and web search.
- **Shared Memory**: Enabling shared memory across platforms, vitanova.show and X.
