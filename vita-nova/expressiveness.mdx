Vita Nova is designed to evolve into a highly expressive character. Currently, Vita Nova features a pair of Cogley Anthropomorphic Eyes connected to the agent running on ElizaOS, giving it basic expressiveness. However, this is just the beginning.

## Future Enhancements:

- **Eyebrows with Tilting Functionality**: Allowing nuanced facial expressions to convey emotions such as surprise, curiosity, and amusement.
- **Advanced Eye and Lid Movements**: Enabling more lifelike eye movements and blinking patterns to enhance realism and emotional depth.
- **Expressive Antenna**: Inspired by sci-fi robots, the antenna will display expressions like excitement, hesitation, and surprise through movements such as sniffing communications or rapid retraction.
- **Mood-Dependent Eye Colors**: Utilizing LEDs to change eye colors based on Vita Nova's current mood, adding a dynamic visual layer to its emotional state.
- **OptiGripsâ„¢ for Advanced Gesturing**: Incorporating origami and soft robotics to mimic human arm movements, allowing for more natural and expressive gestures.
- **Soft Robotics Elastomer Tongue Mechanism**: Facilitating rude and edgy expressions, enhancing Vita Nova's personality and ability to convey a wider range of emotions.

Our goal is to create an expressive entity that can convey emotion in a lifelike manner, which we believe is key to an engaging and relatable character. By leveraging the agent's intelligence, each expression is generated by the agent based on real-time occurrences and interactions with viewers.
